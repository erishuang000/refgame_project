The new embeddings will be initialized from a multivariate normal distribution that has old embeddings' mean and covariance. As described in this article: https://nlp.stanford.edu/~johnhew/vocab-expansion.html. To disable this, use `mean_resizing=False`
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
